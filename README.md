# Project 2 - Part 1

## Stroke Prediction Dataset

Victoria Almazan


### Our goal is to better help our partners understand what is most likley the highest leading causes that attriubte to strokes. We will be diving into understanding key features that will better explain such reason and how to proceed moving forward with better buiness actions.


 The Source of data was provided by Kaggle.
 
 Brief description of Dataset
 - This data set represented is based on a study on strokes being the leading cause of death globally per the World Health Organization. 
 - This data can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX('-1vRdlCBU471ijgzSbXzxQOsloENGNY4bKDRKn50EcCpq7iSCZPkk2N2l7PReD7xNiOJAK5brD5TKdK9x/pub?gid=1457616118&single=true&output=csv')


 What is the target?
 - The target of this data is to predict whether it is likley for a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the different attributes such as age, heart disease, smoking status. I will be showing a few visuals to better help undestand and what we can learn from our dataset. 
 

# For this Data, it was cleaned and prepared the data using the following processing was performed:

## Initial Insights 

- There are 5110 rows, and 12 columns.

## Explanatory Visiuals

- Figure 1, shows us a baseline of 'Male' and 'Female' participants. This helps us better understand the disparity between the two figures.

- Figure 2, represents the number of strokes based on age. We can see here that 'Female' is at a higher variance than 'Male'.

- Figure 3, shows the amount of strokes based on 'Age'.

- Figure 4, represents a count based on smoking status as this is one of our features.

## Multivariate Viziualizations 

- Figure 5, represents features such as 'BMI', 'Age' and 'Gender'. 
- We can assume that the majority of the data has an average bmi of 20- 60. The majority seem to be more female than male.

For figure 5.2, we can see a better representation of 'BMI'.

Figure 6, represents smoking status including 'BMI' and 'Avg Glucose Level'.
